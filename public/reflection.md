# Q1 End of Lessons Reflections
## Claudia Marquesha D. Macatangay - 9 Beryllium
### **List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.**
1. **Operations for js**
-  _Operations are basically math in Javascript, like PEMDAS/GEMDAS. These are good for changing data and controlling the flow of the program._ 
2. **Variable declaration**
-  _A variable declaration is like a box to put the data in. It is usually used when assigned a value._
3. **Basic js statements**
-  _These statements have operations, variables, values, comments, and etc. They basically make the lines needed in Javascript._
4. **Syntax for js**
-  _These are rules on what are allowed in javascript, more specifically, the statements. These rules apply to everything you can do in Javascript._
5. **Loop controls in js**
-  _The loop controls help us manage the behavior of the loop. They let us skip steps and stop loops early._

### **List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.** ###
1. **Js basics**
-  _I know the basics like variables and outputs, but i need more practice combining them to make working programs. Sometimes i get confused when connecting several concepts together._
2. **Js structure**
-  _Structures help control the flow of the program. I need more practice in applying them because i sometimes get mixed up when choosing which structure to use._
3. **Js functions**
-  _Functions let us reuse blocks of code. I need more practice in writing and calling them more because i sometimes forget how to pass arguments and return values._
4. **Data types**
-  _Javascript has types like strings, numbers, and booleans. I need further discussion because i sometimes mix up how operations work differently with each type._
5. **Control flow**
-  _Control flow decides the orderof execution using if, else, or switch. I need more practice because i still struggle with multiple conditions._ 

### **Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.** ###
1. _My plan is to first review my notes and practice coding small examples for each topic. I will also try to watch tutorials on Youtube when I'm having trouble understanding the lesson. Lastly, whenever I have the chance, I will ask Maam Aline or my classmates questions whenever I get confused so I can clear up any confusion quickly._

### **In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?** ###

## EFFECTIVE ##
1. **The speed tests**
-  *Some people may disagree with me because I find that it helps enhance my decision making skills. Also, during the speed tests, we can ask questions to Maam Aline and she will help immediately.*
2. **The 7th graded exercise**
-  _Even if I didnt get perfect, it gave me a hard time which forced me to study it. This made me learn a bit more than what i did know._

## NOT EFFECTIVE ##
1. **Coding Task part of the LT**
-  _I do not like this part. It pisses me off._
2. **Tasks due on weekends**
-  _I want to enjoy my weekends and this ruins it. As a dormer, i technically only have one weekend._
